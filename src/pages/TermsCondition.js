                      discretion of the organization that receives the
                      contributions. It is up to you to confirm nonprofit status
                      and taxable liabilities. In the event that our anti-fraud
                      systems detect behavior which suggests fraudulent use of
                      stolen cards (including "card testing"), we will refund
                      those Contributions without receiving a request from you
                      or the intended recipient and terminate the affected
                      fundraising campaigns, at our discretion. Recipients are
                      not required to accept your Contributions through the
                      Services. You agree that we have no liability to you
                      resulting from any Recipient’s non-acceptance or refund of
                      any Contribution. While Spotfund Technologies makes
                      reasonable efforts to ensure that all Contributions are
                      deposited by their intended Recipients, in the event that
                      a recipient fails for one year to request a disbursement
                      from your contribution will be re-designated as follows:
                      A. for nonprofit contributions, the rejected or unclaimed
                      contributions will be re-designated to a comparable
                      nonprofit as determined by Arbucas Llc. B. for
                      peer-to-peer, peer-to-business, and political
                      contributions, the rejected or unclaimed contributions
                      will be refunded to the user via the original payment
                      method; You are responsible for all chargebacks, refunded
                      or voided Contributions, or other credits or adjustments,
                      fees, interest, penalties or the like in connection with
                      your use of the Services. Contributions may be refunded,
                      voided or adjusted due to, among other things: (a) voiding
                      or adjustment by your bank or card issuer; (b) correction
                      of manifest error; (c) claims made by us or others against
                      you; and/or (d) any actual or proposed Contribution in
                      violation of this Agreement or applicable law. You must
                      deal directly with the other party to the transaction. If
                      we pay any claim, chargeback, refunded or voided
                      Contribution that you make against a Recipient, you agree
                      that we assume your rights against the Recipient, and may
                      pursue those rights directly or on your behalf. If you
                      register to create an account to receive payments via our
                      application, you expressly authorize www.JoinFund-me.com’s
                      payment processor service provider(s) to originate credit
                      transfers to your financial institution account. You must
                      be at least 13 years old and obtain parental permission if
                      under 18 to receive funds. You authorize us to collect and
                      share with our your personal information including full
                      name, email address and financial information, and you are
                      responsible for the accuracy and completeness of that
                      data. www.JoinFund-me.com’s Privacy Policy is available here.
                      D. Refund and Cancellation Policy Donate with intention as
                      refunds for the base donation amount must be secured from
                      the recipient of your Contribution. Requests to change the
                      recipient of a base donation amount may only be requested
                      prior to the transfer of funds to the recipient. After
                      transfer occurs, the funds cannot be sent to another
                      recipient. For all donation types, these transfers can
                      occur as soon as the next day of your donation. E.

                      regulation, including election, campaign finance, and/or

                      misleading information or impersonate any person or

                      system, such as “robots” or “spiders,” to access our

                      violent crimes. All campaigns are subject to internal
                      review for compliance and www.JoinFund-me.com reserves the
                      right to cancel or suspend any campaign for any reason. F.

                      available at www.JoinFund-me,com, which are incorporated
                      herein by reference. We shall disclose to Recipients and,
                      if required, governmental bodies such information about
                      you as a contributor as must be disclosed by law or as may
                      be necessary in order for Recipients to comply with
                      applicable laws. In many cases of political contributions,
                      such governmental bodies are required to make your
                      information public. G. Content and Communications You

                      for via credit or debit card, which will be deducted out
                      of your gross donation amount before the net amount is
                      passed onto the recipient. We reserve the right at our
                      sole discretion to set or revise fees from time to time.

                      other payments, you agree to pay all amounts due upon
                      demand by us. In such event, if any amounts due to us are
                      not paid when due, such amounts shall be subject to a late
                      fee of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by law
                      on such late amounts, whichever is less, and you also will

                      donation or contribution to be made, or allow or cause
                      such Services to be used, you agree and reaffirm that we
                      are authorized to charge your designated card. Your card
                      issuer’s agreement governs your use of your designated

                    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
                    COMPATIBILITY, OR SECURITY, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE
                    SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE. B.
                    NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR SPONSORS, SUPPLIERS OR AGENTS WILL
                    BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES (INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL,
                    SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR LOST REVENUES,
                    PROFITS OR SAVINGS) ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY
                    TO USE THE SERVICES, AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE AND WAIVE ANY
                    CLAIMS WITH RESPECT THERETO, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACTUAL,
                    TORT OR OTHER GROUNDS, EVEN IF WE OR ANY SUCH SPONSOR,
                    SUPPLIER OR AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
                    DAMAGES. AS TO SUCH MATTERS, If you are a California
                    resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code
                    § 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to
                    claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist
                    in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if
                    known by him must have materially affected his settlement
                    with the debtor.” Residents of other states similarly waive
                    their rights under comparable state law. THE ENTIRE
                    LIABILITY OF US AND OUR SPONSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AGENTS AND
                    YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE
                    SERVICES OR ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE LIMITED TO THE
                    LESSER OF: (I) THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR ACCESS TO
                    AND USE OF THE OUR SERVICES IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS
                    PRECEDING THE DATE OF YOUR CLAIM OR (II) U.S.$50.00. YOU
                    HEREBY RELEASE US AND EACH OF OUR SPONSORS, SUPPLIERS AND
                    AGENTS FROM ANY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES AND CLAIMS
                    IN EXCESS OF THIS LIMITATION. You agree that any claim or
                    cause of action arising out of or related to use of OUR
                    SERVICES or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year
                    after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
                    barred. C. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW IMPLIED
                    WARRANTIES TO BE EXCLUDED OR MODIFIED OR LIABILITY TO BE
                    LIMITED, SO NOT ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY APPLY TO
                    YOU.

                    Arbitration; Waiver of Class Action Rights
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    A. You hereby agree that any dispute, claim or controversy
                    (other than those for equitable relief or concerning our
                    intellectual property) between you and us arising from this
                    Agreement (each a “Claim”) shall be resolved by binding
                    arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to appear in
                    court, and you also agree to waive any right that you might
                    have to a jury trial or the opportunity to litigate any
                    Claims in court before a judge or jury. Either you or we may
                    require the submission of a Claim to binding arbitration at
                    any reasonable time notwithstanding that a lawsuit or other
                    proceeding has been commenced. B. Neither you nor we will be
                    entitled to join or consolidate Claims by or against the
                    other in any arbitration, or to include in any arbitration
                    any Claim as a representative or member of a class, or to
                    act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public
                    or in a private attorney general capacity. C. This section
                    10 is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate
                    commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
                    Act (Title 9 of the United States Code, as amended). The
                    party filing a Claim(s) in arbitration must file its
                    Claim(s) before a single arbitrator appointed by the
                    American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its
                    then-current commercial disputes rules. For any Claim of
                    less than $10,000, we may elect non-appearance based
                    arbitration through AAA or another mutually-approved
                    arbitration provider, and in such event the arbitration
                    shall be conducted by telephone, video conference, and/or
                    online, and/or be based solely on written submissions of the
                    parties. The arbitrator must be a lawyer actively engaged in
                    the practice of law or a retired judge, and must have
                    relevant expertise. D. The arbitrator shall not have
                    authority to vary the terms or conditions of this Agreement.
                    The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on the
                    parties, except that either party may seek judicial relief
                    for any alleged failure by the arbitrator to comply with the
                    preceding sentence, and either party may also seek judicial
                    relief to enforce an award if necessary. E. This section 10
                    does not prevent you or us from exercising any lawful rights
                    to other self-help remedies, such as setoff rights. F. You
                    and we each shall take all steps and execute all documents
                    necessary for the implementation of arbitration proceedings.
                    Neither the parties nor the arbitrator may disclose the
                    content or results of any such arbitration, except as
                    required by court order or applicable law, rule or
                    regulation. The parties shall share equally the costs
                    assessed by the AAA or the arbitrator, and other joint costs
                    of the arbitration, but each party shall bear its own
                    attorneys’ and experts’ fees and other costs incurred that
                    are solely attributable to that party’s decisions and
                    actions. G. Subject to the foregoing, you agree that
                    exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute, claim or controversy
                    arising from this Agreement shall be in the federal and
                    state courts located in Texas, U.S.A.

                    The laws of the State of Texas, U.S.A., excluding its
                    conflicts of law rules, govern this Agreement and your use
                    of the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is held
                    to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be

                    failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others
                    does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent
                    or similar breaches. You may not assign or transfer this
                    Agreement or any rights hereunder, and any attempt to the
                    contrary shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence,
                    this Agreement benefits and binds the respective successors
                    and assigns of the parties. We at our sole discretion may

                    provide any other of the Services. We shall not be liable
                    for any delay or failure to perform resulting directly or
                    indirectly from any causes beyond our reasonable control.
                    This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
                    agreements, representations, warranties, understandings or
                    communications between the parties regarding the subject
                    matter herein. There are no third party beneficiaries to

                    at law or in equity, are cumulative and are not intended to
